                better layout text
            implement ideal setup if raining
    misc:
        improve account security. passwords must be encrypted
        add app folder navigation or a way to sync or import/export accounts 
        live race in progress
            make layout red? disable buttons?
        actions functions:
            ~~daily~~
                ~~update labels after press~~
                ~~fix errors and handle if the daily was already claimed~~
            ~~repair~~
            ~~strategy~~
                ~~how? first available strategy? pre-selected?~~
                improve function. it takes too long
        add more stints
            only visual, make it clear
    screens:
        strategy save load style
            layout shouldn't change if no strategies are stored
            save button should be container with preview
        advanced strategy
            changing push level from here should overwrite the stints pushes (update the fuel in the main container or add another label here)
            styling needed to look better
