            save
        add more stints
            only visual, make it clear
    screens:
        strategy save load style
            layout shouldn't change if no strategies are stored
            load should be the preview container   
            save button should be container with preview
        advanced strategy
            changing push level from here should overwrite the stints pushes (update the fuel in the main container or add another label here)
            styling needed to look better
