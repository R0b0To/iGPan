ToDo:
    buttons:
        add weather label for race
            add button for advanced weather?
        race name opens reports of that race
        driver contract
        buy money
        change engine supplier or manage own engine
        change fuel supplier
        change tyre supplier
        driver
        restore stamina
        
    tabs:
        team tab
            driver
            staff
            market?
        practice
            improve layout
        setup
            add suggestion after practice laps?
            implement ideal setup if raining
    misc:
        live race in progress
            make layout red? disable buttons?
        actions functions:
            daily
                update labels after press
                fix errors and handle if the daily was already claimed
            repair
            strategy
                how? first available strategy? pre-selected?
        add more stints
            only visual, make it clear
    screens:
        strategy save load style
            layout shouldn't change if no strategies are stored
            save button should be container with preview
        advanced strategy
            changing push level from here should overwrite the stints pushes (update the fuel in the main container or add another label here)
            styling needed to look better
